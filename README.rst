Cookiecutter Django Project Template by uranusjr
=================================================

This is the template I use as a starting point to my Django projects. Or maybe
I should say I *want to* use this as a starting pointâ€”this template is far
from complete, and I intend to add things from various Django projects I work
on as I see them.

Python code is written with only Python 3 in mind. I almost always use Python 3
now, and you should too, especially on a new project.
